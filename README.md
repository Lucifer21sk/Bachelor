# Bachelor Repository

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Bachelor's degree project.

## IMPORTANT !! 

First people need to download the dataset of the images from this website https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/felipekitamura/unifesp-xray-bodypart-classification

## Project Description

The aim of this bachelor thesis is to classify X-ray images of body parts using neural networks. The bachelor thesis will introduce the methods of deep learning, and its use for the classification of X-ray images. Propose and test different neural network methods and architectures for image classification on the studied dataset of X-ray images of different human body parts. Based on the initial results,I will try to analyze the possible classification problems of the different classes studied, focusing on the quality and quantity of the data provided. I will try to eliminate these shortcomings using different methods to maximize the efficiency of the resulting classification. 

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows in the file bakalarka:

- `code/`: This directory contains the source codes.
- `data/`: This directory contains the csv and the structure of the images.
- `images/`: This directory contains the results of train and test on CNN models.
- `archive.zip`: This zip containes the dataset of images from website kaggle that was used to train and test CNN models.
- `Performance.xlsx`: This is a excel file that shows the results of different experiments.

## INFO
This is not application and was not created to be an aplication, this was just a test and analyzation of different augmentations and solving different problems with this dataset. If you want to read about what i did then docx files are the thesis in slovak language and english.
